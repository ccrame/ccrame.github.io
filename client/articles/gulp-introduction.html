<p><br>Gulp is a way to automate tasks during development. Instead of running multiple commands for syntax check, minification and concatanatenation of files, and etc…, it is possible to just run the gulp command and all the mentioned tasks will run in the order they were specified.<br><br>It is also very simple to use.</p>
<p>To start off, install gulp by typing <code>npm install --save-dev gulp</code>.  This line of code will ensure that gulp is also stored into the dev dependencies of your package.json.  Once that is done, create a js file. </p>
<p>The gulp file should include necessary dependencies.  In order to use jshint, the gulp module of jshint is required, so type <code>npm install --save-dev gulp-jshint</code> to take care of that. Once all of the dependencies are installed, a simple gulp file looks something like this: </p>
<pre><code>
  var gulp = require('gulp');
  var jshint = require('gulp-jshint');

  gulp.task('syntaxCheck', function(){
    gulp.src(['app/script/script.js'])
      .pipe(jshint());
  });

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there are a lot of useful properties within the gulp object.  To create a task, simply use <code>gulp.task(&#39;taskName&#39;,callbackFunction);</code>.  Any actions to be performed by this task is included in the callback function.  <code>gulp.src()</code> takes a pathname as an argument and any action performed is done on the file specified here.  Every action performed on the file is added by using the <code>gulp.pipe()</code> function.  In the above example, after the source is given, “gulp-jshint” is used to check the syntax of the file.</p>
<p>To run this task, simply type <code>gulp syntaxCheck</code> on your console.  To set a default task for gulp, simply create a task called “default” and pass an array of tasks as the second argument.  </p>
<pre><code>
  gulp.task('default',['syntaxCheck']);
  
</code></pre>

<p>Once the above code snippet is included, typing <code>gulp</code> on the console will run the “syntaxCheck” gulp task.  </p>
