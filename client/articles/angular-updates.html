<p>Using Angular? Two way data-binding not showing? This is a common problem that can cause headaches. A quick search on your favorite search engine will 
show that many people have the same problem. This article will go over two common ways to get around this issue.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2 class="large">$apply</h2>
<br>
<p>$apply forces any changes in the scope to be reflected on-screen. This is accomplished by using a callback. Here is a simple example using Firebase listeners.</p>
<pre><code>
  <span></span>var ref = new Firebase('https://data.firebaseio.com');
  <span></span>var data = ref.child("data");
  <span></span>$scope.array = [];
  <span></span>
  <span></span>data.on("child_added",function(info){
  <span></span>  $scope.$apply(function(){
  <span></span>    $scope.array.push(info.val());
  <span></span>  });
  <span></span>});

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it’s very simple to use. Just use apply to enclose the statement that refuses to update on its own. After using this, you will notice that the data does indeed update. You may also notice errors springing up. Don’t worry. The fix is just as simple.</p>
<pre><code>
  <span></span>data.on("child_added", function(info){
  <span></span>  if(!$scope.$$phase){
  <span></span>    $scope.$apply(function(){
  <span></span>      $scope.array.push(info.val());
  <span></span>    })
  <span></span>  } else {
  <span></span>    $scope.array.push(info.val());
  <span></span>  }
  <span></span>});

</code></pre>

<p>The error is caused by Angular attempting to perform an action multiple times. By adding the check to <code>$scope.$$phase</code>, the code makes sure that the action is only performed once per cycle. Now, if you are planning to use this code throughout your controllers, it may be a good idea to put this code into a factory:</p>
<pre><code>
  <span></span>// In the Factory 'appFactory'
  <span></span>Obj.apply = function(scope,cb){
  <span></span>  if(!scope.$$phase){
  <span></span>    scope.$apply(function(){
  <span></span>      cb.call(this,scope);
  <span></span>    })
  <span></span>  } else {
  <span></span>    cb.call(this,scope);
  <span></span>  }
  <span></span>};
  <span></span>
  <span></span>// In the Controller
  <span></span>data.on("child_added", function(info){
  <span></span>  appFactory.apply($scope,function(scope){
  <span></span>    scope.array.push(info.val());
  <span></span>  });
  <span></span>});

</code></pre>

<p>Now it is much simpler to re-use this code within any controller.</p>
<br>
<br>


<h2 class="large">$watch</h2>
<br>
<p>This is another way to perform an update in Angular. The data is actually always up to date, only it is not shown on the screen. With this method, it is 
easy to perform an action when a change is observed within the scope. The $watch method takes two arguments, both callback functions. The first callback requires a return statement 
and it is the change in this statement that triggers the second callback function.</p>

<pre><code>
  <span></span>$scope.messages= [];
  <span></span>$scope.lastMessage = '';
  <span></span>
  <span></span>$scope.$watch(function(scope){
  <span></span>  return scope.messages.length;
  <span></span>}, function(newVal,oldVal){
  <span></span>  $scope.lastMessage = $scope.messages[$scope.messages.length - 1];
  <span></span>});

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the second callback takes two arguments.  The first argument is the new value returned by the previous callback function.  The second argument is the old value, or the original value of the previous callback function to which the new value is compared. When these two values are different from each other, the second callback function is triggered. In the example above, neither value from the second callback function is used. However, it is still triggered due to the difference in the two values. </p>
