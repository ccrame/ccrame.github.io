<p>Here is a solution to a simple toy problem. There are several ways to solve this, but the heart of the problem is the method used to check if a number is prime.</p>



<pre><code>
  var solution = function(){ 
    var total = 0;
    var primes = 0;
    var number = 0;

    // function to check if a number is a prime
    var isPrime = function(num){
      if(num === 2 || num === 3){return true;}
      if(num === 1 || num % 2 === 0){return false;}
      for(var i = 3; i <= Math.floor(Math.sqrt(num)); i += 2){
        if(num % i === 0){return false;}
      }
      return true;
    };

    while(primes < 1000){
      if(isPrime(++number)){
        total += number;
        primes++;
      }
    }

    return total;
  };

  solution(); // 3682913

<p>The <code>isPrime</code> function listed above is heavily optimized to skip a lot of repetition. As a lot of people already know, a number should only be checked for divisibility 
until we get to the number's square root. For example, if we use the number 36, any number past 6 that goes evenly into 36 is a pair of a previous number that we already encountered. 
Therefore, any number past the 6 will be a repeated check. 36 is divisible by 4, but if we go further, we will see that it is also divisible by 9.
</p>

<p>This concept is used in the function above. A further optimization is to check only odd numbers as all even numbers are divisible by 2. This easily cuts in half the number of 
required checks to perform.</p>
