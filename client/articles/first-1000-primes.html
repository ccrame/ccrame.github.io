<p>Here is a solution to a simple toy problem. There are several ways to solve this, but the heart of the problem is the method used to check if a number is prime.</p>



<pre><code>
  <span></span>var solution = function(){ 
  <span></span>  var total = 0;
  <span></span>  var primes = 0;
  <span></span>  var number = 0;
  <span></span>
  <span></span>  // function to check if a number is a prime
  <span></span>  var isPrime = function(num){
  <span></span>    if(num === 2 || num === 3){return true;}
  <span></span>    if(num === 1 || num % 2 === 0){return false;}
  <span></span>    for(var i = 3; i <= Math.floor(Math.sqrt(num)); i += 2){
  <span></span>      if(num % i === 0){return false;}
  <span></span>    }
  <span></span>    return true;
  <span></span>  };
  <span></span>
  <span></span>  while(primes < 1000){
  <span></span>    if(isPrime(++number)){
  <span></span>      total += number;
  <span></span>      primes++;
  <span></span>    }
  <span></span>  }
  <span></span>
  <span></span>  return total;
  <span></span>};
  <span></span>
  <span></span>solution(); // 3682913

</code></pre>


<p>The <code>isPrime</code> function listed above is heavily optimized to skip a lot of repetition. As a lot of people already know, a number should only be checked for divisibility 
until we get to the number's square root. For example, if we use the number 36, any number past 6 that goes evenly into 36 is a pair of a previous number that we already encountered. 
Therefore, any number past the 6 will be a repeated check. 36 is divisible by 4, but if we go further, we will see that it is also divisible by 9.

<p>This concept is used in the function above. A further optimization is to check only odd numbers as all even numbers are divisible by 2. This easily cuts in half the number of 
required checks to perform.</p>
